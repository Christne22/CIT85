            Disneyland's Fantasmic
         </p>
         <p class="recent">
            Fantasmic! originated at Disneyland in 1992 after Walt Disney Creative Entertainment was asked to create a
            nighttime spectacular involving water and fireworks to reinvigorate the space in front of the Rivers of
            America. The area was reworked, including terracing the walkways to accommodate viewing and modifying part
            of Tom Sawyer Island to allow the show's staged live action segments. The producers employed the resources
            of Walt Disney Feature Animation and Walt Disney Imagineering.
            An updated version of Disneyland's Fantasmic!
            debuted in 2017, featuring a re-recorded soundtrack in addition to new scenes, lighting, choreography and
            costumes. A third version premiered at Disneyland in 2022 with new clouded lasers and searchlights in the
            viewing area. A fourth version
            premiered at Disneyland in 2023 with new audio-animatronic dragon, which is part of Disney 100 Years of
            Wonder celebration.

            Disneyland dragon catches fire during Fantasmic!
         </p>
         <p class="recent">
            A fire broke out at Disneyland on Saturday after an animatronic dragon was engulfed in flames during a live
            performance at the California theme park.
            On 22 April, the 45-foot dragon caught fire during a performance of “Fantasmic!” at Disneyland park in
            Anaheim, California. The fire was reported at around 11pm local time when Anaheim Fire and Rescue officials
            assisted the Disneyland Fire Department with putting out the fire on Tom Sawyer Island.
            The fire occurred near the end of the 30-minute “Fantasmic!” show, in which Mickey Mouse must defeat a
            “fire-breathing dragon” named Maleficent. In videos captured during Saturday night's performance, the fire
            engulfed the dragon's head before spreading to its neck and body.
            All cast members and guests were then evacuated from Tom Sawyer Island and attractions near the dragon due
            to smoke and wind, Disneyland said in a statement. “We are temporarily suspending fire effects similar to
            those used at Disneyland park's Fantasmic! at select shows and entertainment experiences globally out of
            an abundance of caution following the Fantasmic! prop fire,” a spokesperson told the New York Times.
            The cause of the fire still remains under investigation, but performances of “Fantasmic!” have since been
            removed from the Disneyland online schedule.
