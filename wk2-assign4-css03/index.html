         To all who come to this happy place, welcome. Disneyland is your land. Here age relives fond memories of the
         past and here youth may savor the challenge and promise of the future. Disneyland is dedicated to the ideals,
         dreams, and the hard facts that have created America, with the hope that it will be a source of joy and
         inspiration to all the world.
         ~ Walter Elias Disney ~

         This is my wish for you: Comfort on difficult days, smiles when sadness intrudes, rainbows to follow the
         clouds,
         laughter to kiss your lips, sunsets to warm your heart, hugs when spirits sag, beauty for your eyes to see,
         friendships to brighten your being, faith so that you can believe, confidence for when you doubt, courage to
         know
         yourself, patience to accept the truth, Love to complete your life. ~ Ralph Waldo Emerson ~
