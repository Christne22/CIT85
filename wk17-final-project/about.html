                  To all who come to this happy place: Welcome. Disneyland is your
                  land. Here, age relives
                  fond memories of the past, and here youth may savor the challenge and promise of the
                  future. Disneyland is dedicated to the ideals, the dreams, and the hard facts that have
                  created
                  America, with the hope that it will be a source of joy and inspiration to all the world.

                  <i>Walt Disney &bull; July 17, 1955</i>
                  <br></br>
                  At the age of 5, my parents took me for the first time to Disneyland - and from that time, I was
                  hooked! My love for Disneyland runs so deep, that the first opportunity I had to take my son, I did!
                  Although he was only 10wks old at the time, and is now a 21yr old young man, this photo of him is
                  still the single-most cherished photo of him in Disneyland! To see the park through
                  his eyes was so magical because it reminded me in some ways just why I loved it all so much!
                  <br></br>
                  I suppose that I could have written about so many of the things I love... including cake decorating, my Sicilian heritage, how I landed at Fresno City College after a 30yr hiatus in attenting college, or one of the many other personal topics about myself
                  <br></br>
                  <i>... HOWEVER... </i>
                  <br></br>
                  DISNEYLAND will always be - hands down - the one subject that I am always unwaveringly passionate
                  about.
