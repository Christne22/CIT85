                  My two cats are such a blessing to have! My son lost his first cat (that he had since he was 2) just a
                  few days before his 10th birthday.
                  <br></br>
                  We didn't think that we were going to find 1 kitten - let alone 2 - that were the age that we hoped
                  for.
                  <br></br>
                  Fun fact that I had no clue about (and I've been a cat owner my entire life)... cats are typically
                  born in the Spring/Summer months, however RARELY born in the Winter!

                  <b>Their Adoption Story</b>
                  <br></br>
                  After my sonâ€™s 1st cat passed away, all he could talk about was how much he wanted more than anything
                  to get a new kitten for his double-digit birthday.
                  <br></br>
                  After hours of looking online & calling all around, I found 2 kittens at the Sacramento Animal
                  Shelter.
                  <br></br>
                  These two kittens were picked up by Animal Control the night before our cat died. Due to their age
                  they were housed together, however they are not from the same litter!

                  A silver snowshoe kitten is a charming and beautiful feline companion. Snowshoe cats are known for
                  their striking coat pattern, which typically features a combination of white fur with patches of
                  darker color, such as silver or gray. The silver variety specifically showcases a silvery hue in their
                  coat, adding to their unique and eye-catching appearance.
                  <br></br>
                  Snowshoe kittens have distinctive markings on their paws, resembling little white "snowshoes," which
                  gives them their name. This breed is also known for their striking blue eyes, which provide a
                  captivating contrast against their coat.
                  <br></br>
                  In addition to their stunning appearance, silver snowshoe kittens are known to be affectionate and
                  sociable companions. They often form strong bonds with their human family members and enjoy being part
                  of the household activities. Snowshoes are typically friendly and enjoy interacting with both adults
                  and children, making them great family pets.

                  A Snowshoe Siamese kitten is an adorable and distinctive feline companion. Snowshoe Siamese cats are a
                  breed that originated from the crossbreeding of Siamese cats with American Shorthair cats. They are
                  known for their unique coat pattern and charming personality.
                  <br></br>
                  Snowshoe Siamese kittens have a striking coat pattern that typically consists of a light-colored body
                  with darker points on their ears, face, paws, and tail. The points can come in various colors, such as
                  seal, blue, chocolate, and lilac. The defining feature of Snowshoe Siamese cats is the white
                  "snowshoe" markings on their paws, which resemble little white mittens.
                  <br></br>
                  In addition to their distinct appearance, Snowshoe Siamese kittens have a friendly and affectionate
                  nature. They enjoy being around people and often form strong bonds with their human family members.
